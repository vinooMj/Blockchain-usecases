In 2022, the global bond market totaled $133 trillion. Tokenized bonds are already capturing a portion of this market 

A few great examples:

ðŸ‡­ðŸ‡° Hong Kong successfully offered the inaugural $100M tokenized green bond
ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º European Investment Bank (EIB) issues $86.6M blockchain bond using HSBC Orion tokenization platform
ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· CrÃ©dit Agricole CIB, SEB launch public sustainable blockchain bond network
ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¬ DBS Bank issued a $15M digital bond in the first security token offering

1 - So how does bond tokenization work?

Bond tokenization represents the ownership of a bond instrument represented by a token hosted on a blockchain.

A blockchain represents a digital ledger of timestamped and immutable records that grows as new data is added. Blockchains are hosted in multiple nodes in a network and 
they use decentralization and cryptography to validate transactions.

The ledgers are open and transparent, and the smart contracts execute the terms of the blockchain-issued bonds, in place of the conventional documentation process.

2 - Creating & Issuing Blockchain Bonds

Orders that comprise bids and bonds from investors are then recorded in the DLT in immutable forms. A distributed ledger can be operated in a public or private network 
that hosts digital assets. The issuer of the blockchain bond then develops a term sheet that is incorporated into the smart contracts. The issuer can then add 
investors to bid on the blockchain-issued bond, based on the Know-Your-Customer metrics.

The tokens in question are used to value the issued bond. Although blockchain-issued bonds are at their initial development phase, it is viewed as a potential 
industry disruptor. 
Besides this, blockchain-issued bonds are created with programmable codes, and they are settled almost in real time.

Transaction reconciliation is simplified, as all the nodes in the network have a copy. Coupon payments can be sent to the wallets of the investors. 
Investors can trade their bonds over the counter or in a decentralized exchange. The custody and bond servicing in the traditional issuance is eliminated in the 
blockchain issued bonds.
 
3 - Blockchain Bonds vs Traditional Bonds

Traditional bonds have a lengthy issuance process compared to blockchain bonds. Conventional bonds also use multiple intermediaries, where information asymmetry can 
lead to inefficiencies.

The lack of standardization in the traditional bond markets leads to inefficient securities pricing. On the contrary, the decentralized nature of blockchain bonds 
eliminates the need for intermediaries, giving the bondholder more savings.

While traditional bonds are owned and regulated by specific entities, blockchain bonds have a variety of digital assets in a decentralized database for freedom of 
choice. The lengthy settlement processes in the traditional bond market lead to settlement risks and more costs.
