If EVs are to really work at scale we need

1. A Decentralised Grid - that is generation of energy using solar and storage of energy in your car and home batteries.

2. A Decentralised Energy Marketplace - that is peer to peer trading of energy.

The old world of centralisation wonâ€™t be able to cope with the energy demand real time.

We need to build the following
- identity of EV and charge points etc.
- car eWallet, ability for car, battery and charge points to trade in an economy of things
- incentive and governance models for community based (solar) projects and community based energy trading marketplaces

This is all about blockchains. The tokenisation of energy is vital to save the world. Just saying
