The highlights are:

- Digitization of the capital market, e.g. B. the possibility of issuing shares with electronic securities is created (e.g. with blockchain technology or 
comparable technologies)

- Examination of improved portability of crypto assets

- Greater digitization and internationalization of supervision and supervisory law
