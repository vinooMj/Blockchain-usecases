Emerging Applications For Blockchain In Railways

▶Predictive Maintenance : - Since every train is consisting of thousands of mechanical and electrical parts, rolling stock maintenance is critical for safe movement.
✔️Blockchain with IOT connected sensors can enable modern preventive maintenance where in health of every part of rolling stock is monitored on Blockhain

▶Traffic Management: - Current traffic control in railway networks has unexpected challenges like single system failures, communication loss, manual error , driver's 
condition , adhoc traffic diversion, collision and derailments .
✔️Blockchain can help deploy safety frameworks with decentralised control

▶Automated Charging/Payments : -
✔️With Blockchain, the allocation of railway infrastructure creation, rights and its charging/payments can happen in near real time, governed by consensus and also 
automated by smart contracts
