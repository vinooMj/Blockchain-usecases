Sony, like many of the behemoths in the gaming niche, has been exploring blockchain tech and use cases for quite some time:

 March 2023: Sony publishes patent to use NFTs to trade digital assets

This latest patent, submitted in 2021, was published last week and focuses on integrating NFTs into games while allowing for trading across consoles. Specifically mentioning Xbox and PlayStation as an example 👀

The TL;DR:

 Players can earn NFTs in the form of skins or other popular in-game assets
 Players can trade or send these to other players on the play station network
 NFTs could be transferred to other end-user entities or platforms
 If implemented, PS5 users can utilize NFTs in mainstream gaming titles
 Potential use of AI to provide better asset price discovery
