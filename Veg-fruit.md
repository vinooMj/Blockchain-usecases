A real-life use case of #blockchain based decentral data platform / marketplace for life-science business!
#Blockchain for quality control

As a consumer, how can i develop the #trust in #quality certificates of fruits and vegetable I buy in the supermarket?

The concept in this paper revolves around reference materials i.e the materials needed to calibrate lab instruments and to perform test on samples like fruits, 
vegetables etc. These tests are an essential part of quality checks for broad range of clients in variety 
of industries including food and pharmaceuticals.

#PwC & #Merck have developed jointly the concept of blockchain based #digitally enhanced reference materials (DERM) which can increase the trust in the quality by
providing the complete provenance of test samples.

Reference materials from #Merck are the root of trust in the physical world while blockchain is the root of trust in the digital world.

The DERM concept is a perfect example for the convergence of multiple technologies like #iot , #blockchain , #dataanalytics , #ai / ML and #m2m communication 
transforming the conventional business model of reference material towards #pay-per use / #pay-per performance.
