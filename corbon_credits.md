Carbon credit and carbon offset.

As part my tokenomics learning & specialization exercise I was trying to evaluate the carbon tokens. These are asset-based tokens it is hard to evaluate at the moment
as none of the carbon indexes show the asset being held by them. So, the current market price might a speculative. We need to know the amount of volume of carbon asset
held, this is again very difficult as these are intangible asset unlike gold, oil or real estate. If we can get this data probably there will be a way to assess the 
real value of the token against the market. As a tokenomist we can then suggest buying or wait.

Carbon credit tokens are asset class where people can invest as a portfolio of investment.

Carbon credits are policy or government driven and offset are policy and voluntary driven. It is difficult to track voluntary offset but it is good if the voluntary 
offset market increases. How the governments are tracking this is still a question as you need a regulator or person who can audit these to confirm the offset as 
against leaving them to the companies to decide.

If someone has been able to evaluate the carbon credit tokens / asset-based tokens will be happy to connect and learn from them.

How can a company or individual offset carbon?
There are two aspects Primary and Secondary footprint. The Primary footprint accounts for House, Flight, Car, Bike, Bus and Rail usage. A company or an Individual 
can measure the approximated emissions for a year by tracking various consumptions like electricity, flight travel, Car, Bus & Rail, Fuel, burning of oil, coal, LPG, 
Wooden Pallets, Food, Pharma, clothing etc., you get an approximate carbon emission. You can offset by planting trees or supporting community projects which are
traceable and verifiable.

Large events, big fat weddings, political rallies, Sports events etc., consume large amounts of electricity, fuel, food etc., For these events we should make 
it mandatory for the organizers to offset carbon emissions. The government is currently focusing is on industrial emissions, but you cannot ignore these big events 
as well. Today there is a big fat wedding or event happening throughout the year. This can be one of the initiatives to reduce carbon emission. I would like to see 
a wedding couple coming up and planting trees to offset emission or political party leader planting trees for each big rally. Leading from the front will be a good 
example.

Blockchain can help track and trace carbon emissions and offset. The next big use case here as we have target to meet to become net zero.
