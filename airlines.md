Argentinian airline Flybondi allows customers to resell their tickets as NFTs

Flybondi, an Argentine ultralow-cost carrier, has allowed its customers to resale their tickets.

The Buenos Aires-based airline made a name for itself as a pioneer in ticketing in March 2023 when it started selling its tickets as non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, on the Algorand Blockchain in collaboration with TravelX, an NFT ticketing startup. Since then, consumers have been able to rename, gift, or transfer tickets using the Ticket 3.0 platform—as Flybondi.com refers to it—all without having to talk with a representative.


As the price of the ticket rises over time, just like the price of a commodity or asset, the consumer makes a profit while the airline also increases its revenue by enabling them to make such a sale and collecting a fee in the process.

Application of emerging technologies (like Blockchain, Web3, NFT, AI, etc) to solve real-world applications is the need of the hour.
