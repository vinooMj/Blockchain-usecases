What Are Dynamic NFTs?

Dynamic NFTs are a sub-category of NFTs whose characteristics can be altered when certain conditions are met. Every NFT contains information called metadata, 
which describes its characteristics.

Dynamic NFT Applications:

1/ Identity

If blockchain-based identity becomes a reality, dynamic NFTs may actually be used to represent digital identity cards or passports around the world. The flexibility 
of these NFTs would allow changes to be updated automatically without digital identity documents needing replacement. 
This can include details like place of residence, marital status, and contact details..

2/ Gaming

The ERC-1155 token standard is used mainly in NFT gaming, so it’s no surprise that dynamic NFTs are most commonly found in blockchain games. Players can level up 
their avatars using dynamic NFTs to represent their in-game characters, thereby enhancing the gaming experience. As a player gains more experience, their characters’ 
growth could be reflected in their NFT avatars’ changing appearances or stats.

The concept of progress in games is essential in game design in order to engage players, and dynamic NFTs make this possible. Dynamic NFTs could also facilitate
choose-your-own-ending games and other participatory experiences that require external data to work.

3/ Virtual real estate

While real estate tokenization has been around for some time, static NFTs are unable to reflect changing factors, like property prices, age, and ownership. Dynamic 
NFTs, on the other hand, can capture the finer details of real estate and possess the flexibility needed for specific information updates.

4/ Art

As exemplified by the traditional Japanese aesthetic art form wabi-sabi, which focuses on transience instead of permanence, art that is fleeting and transitionary 
is widely appreciated worldwide. Thanks to dynamic NFTs, digital artists can use real-time data to encode changes in their artwork to convey this impermanence, making 
their art pieces more unique. For instance, there are dynamic NFT artworks whose appearances change based on the current weather or season.

NFT art can also be elevated by mimicking real-world art installations that require audience participation to be appreciated. In this instance, a dynamic NFT could 
change depending on the token holder’s interaction with their asset and in doing so, advance engagement at digital art exhibitions.
