oken economy -  smart home vision for IoT plus blockchain plus AI is to:

1. hook up solar panels (either on the apartment block roof or buy a share in a solar project).
2. Then I can charge my car at night using my car EV electric tariff balanacing against my solar inputs
3. Trade in excess solar via the token economy as energy is tokenised
4. Convert energy money (tokens) into health money (tokens) and buy healthcare services (e.g. metaverse base physio for my MS linked to AI to monitor muscle progession)
- as healthcare is tokenised
5. Sell access to my health data via NFT to earn health tokens (I'm on Ocrevus now so this is helpful for the drug R&D #roche)
6. Voice control throughout the house (lights, plugs etc.) as I can't really walk too well with MS.
