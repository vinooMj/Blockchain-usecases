The government is aiming to revamp the E-waste policy to improve lifecycle management and introduce incentivized measures. 

According to the Global E-Waste Monitor, India ranked third in generating 3.2 million tonnes of e-waste in 2019. However, only 10% 
of the e-waste generated in the country was collected, and it is projected to reach 11.5 million metric tonnes by 2025. 

In light of these statistics, the crucial question arises: Can technology bring solutions that effectively manage the lifecycle of 
E-waste and provide incentives to collectors for efficient work?

When considering Blockchain technology, it possesses features that have the potential to address and solve this problem.

Supply Chain Transparency: Blockchain can provide transparency and traceability throughout the entire lifecycle of electronic devices. 
This transparency helps identify responsible parties and encourages accountability for the proper handling of E-Waste.

Asset Tracking and Lifecycle Management: Each device can be uniquely identified and recorded on the blockchain, along with information 
such as ownership, maintenance history, and disposal methods. This ensures proper documentation and helps prevent illegal practices like 
unauthorized exports or improper disposal.

Incentivizing Recycling and Circular Economy: Blockchain-based tokens or rewards systems can be implemented to incentivize individuals and 
organizations to recycle or properly dispose of electronic devices. 

Auditing and Compliance: Blockchain can provide a tamper-proof and auditable record of E-Waste management activities. 

Collaboration and Data Sharing: Blockchain can facilitate secure and decentralized data sharing among stakeholders involved in E-Waste
management, including manufacturers, recyclers, government agencies, and consumers.
