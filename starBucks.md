Called "Odyssey", it lets users collect stamps by completing gamified, branded journeys. 

These stamps generate points that unlock rewards. 

Odyssey launched in December 2022 and still runs in “beta". 

It has about 35,000 members. 

That’s 0.04% of its 75m Starbucks Rewards members.

Starbucks generated at least $1,040,000 in its first year...

– by selling limited edition stamps
– and a 7.5% royalty fee on secondary trades

...with 0.04% of its 75 million Starbucks Rewards members.

For context: Starbucks made over $900K of revenue per store in 2022.

And it has about 38,000 stores globally. 

Back to Odyssey. Let’s estimate: 

* 1% of Rewards members = $26 million/year.
* 5% of Reward members = $130 million/year.
* 10% of Reward members = $240 million/year.

$240 million is about 0.7% of Starbucks' 2023 total revenue.

Not bad for a loyalty program, right?

These calculations are rough, but they show the potential.

30% of Starbucks’ global sales come from Starbucks Reward members. 

They are 𝟱.𝟲 𝘁𝗶𝗺𝗲𝘀 more likely to visit daily compared to non-members.

I bet that his number is even higher for Odyssey members. 

Starbucks:

"We believe NFTs have broad potential to create an expanded, shared-ownership model for loyalty, the offering of unique experiences, community building, storytelling, and customer engagement.”

I’m curious to see if and how Starbucks integrates Odyssey into Starbucks Rewards.
